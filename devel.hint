ldesc: "Ogg project codecs use the Ogg bitstream format to arrange the 
raw, compressed bitstream into a more robust, useful form.  For example, 
the Ogg bitstream makes seeking, time stamping and error recovery 
possible, as well as mixing several sepearate, concurrent media streams 
into a single physical bitstream."
